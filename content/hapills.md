<p class="intro">Here I share some little quick videos that I recorded for posting them to Twitter. They are about topics related to Hexagonal Architecture</p>

### 1.- FROM MVC TO HEXAGONAL.

See how elements of a classic MVC web application matches with the ones of a hexagonal application.

### 2.- TEST CASES AS DRIVERS.

In an hexagonal application, test cases are drivers that need access to driven actors. This can be done directly (Back Door Manipulation Test) or through the hexagon API (Round Trip Test).

### 3.- DEVELOPMENT SEQUENCE.

This video illustrates the steps recommended by Alistair Cockburn to develop an hexagonal application from scratch, until you finally have the hexagon with all the adpaters it needs.

### 4.- NESTED HEXAGONS vs HEXAGONS NETWORK.

Hexagons are so easy to draw that we can draw them everywhere. Drawing one inside another is not correct though. On the other hand, we can draw hexagons communicating with others in a network. You can see it in this video. Take a look.
